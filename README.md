Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## User Stories

I have done mutiple ioT projects in the past.  It always took me a lot of time to remember all the library changes when the hardware has changed or updated.  I am going to document all required changes as my reference:

* [X] LCD library is not always work for Ardrino 1.6 use the library<rgb_lcd.h> for Galileo Gen2 and Grove LCD from Grove toolkit
* [X] Andrino libraries is stored in **Document/Andrino** folder by default
* [X] Try to run the examples from the library to ensure all the hardware are running as expected with the default code
